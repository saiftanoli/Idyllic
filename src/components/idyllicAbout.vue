    <h1>Idyllic: from conception to completion</h1>
    <p>
      Idyllic is a long-established Cornish joinery company with more than 15
      years experience in exclusive flooring across the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using modern machinery, traditional methods and a wealth of knowledge,
      Idyllic creates fine flooring and worktops custom designed to the highest
      quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cornish oak used by Idyllic is sourced from the sustainable woodlands
      of Tregothnan Estate in Cornwall, from trees felled as part of the natural
      thinning process associated with good forestry management.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineered wood flooring market is currently awash in cheaper less
      sustainable wood from often, far flung places.
    </p>

    <p>
      Idyllic sources wood locally to preserve endangered rainforests and reduce
      transportation miles, therefore minimising the carbon footprint.
    </p>
    <p>
      While remaining particular about the source of its timber, Aspen and Ash
      invites its clients to share the journey of the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      All flooring produced by Idyllic, from when it is felled, cut, kiln dried,
      finished, to when it is sent out, is completed at the workshop at Redruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This natural material can be contrasted against chic ultra modern
      furnishings or used to complement period features to great effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the forest to floor, Idyllic flooring is handmade with precision and
      passion, bringing warmth and character into your home.
